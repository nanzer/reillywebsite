	<div class="research-article"><p>MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and MC Statistical  Methods are very powerful statistical techniques for parameter estimation and  related problems. They are particularly useful for the difficult nonlinear or  non-Gaussian case. Using a large data set, these techniques can also be used to  make inference on parameters, to integrate nuisance parameters, to evaluate  functions numerically or to solve optimization problems.<strong> </strong><br>
	  We have  applied these methods to several interesting problems: <strong></strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Joint model order detection and  DOA estimation in coloured noise </strong>(J-R. Larocque)<br>
        Model order detection has always been a difficult problem in array signal  processing when the noise is coloured. A novel reversible jump MCMC approach  has been proposed to solve this problem [1].</li>
      <li><strong>Tracking of multiple targets using arrays of  sensors </strong>(J-R. Larocque)<br>
        In this project, arrays of sensors are used to detect the number of targets and  to jointly track their directions of arrival using particle filters or  sequential Monte Carlo approaches. These methods approach real-time efficiency  and show considerable advantages over previous techniques [2]. </li>
      <li><strong>Wideband  Array Processing </strong>(William Ng)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>MCMC and sequential MC methods were used to develop  an array processing algorithm for extraction of a signal of interest in the  presence of multiple interfering sources for the more difficult wideband case  [3].<strong></strong></p>
