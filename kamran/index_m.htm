<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Blind Source Separation (BSS) problem arises in several different fields of study. In speech communication, a microphone in a room can simultaneously receive a mixture of several speech signals that need to be separated to render intelligible results. In biological studies, the sensors receive different electrical excitations where usually only one is of interest. In rotating machine vibration analysis for fault diagnosis, it is desired to separate the vibration due to faulty components. In each case, at least N sensors receive mixtures of N (statistically independent) sources. The objective is to restore (separate) the sources by observing only the mixtures. There are two classes of BSS algorithm, depending on the mixing process. In the scalar or instantaneous mixing case, the transfer function from each source to each sensor is a simple scalar. In the convolutive case, this transfer function is dynamic, with a nontrivial impulse response. In the vast majority of practical applications, the mixing is convolutive. Unfortunately, the BSS problem is far more difficult for the convolutive case than for the scalar case. Nevertheless, it is very important to develop a good solution for the instantaneous case, before extending it to the convolutive mixing problem. In this research, we are focusing on both of these cases, but with more emphasis on convolutive blind signal separation, since it has more practical significance.</FONT><BR>
