            <p class="f">This project has to do with non-destructive testing of 
              installed pipelines. Oil and gas carried by the pipelines can contain 
              relatively high levels of sulphur, which is corrosive to the steel 
              pipe. If this corrosion is left unchecked, it may result in rupture 
              of the pipeline. The ensuing environmental damage would be catastrophic. 
              Pipelines must therefore be closely monitored and inspected to ensure 
              that any corrosion or defects in the pipe wall have not affected 
              the integrity of the pipe. The preferred method of inspection is 
              to collect data using an autonomous device referred to as a "pig" 
              or inspection tool, that is propelled down the pipeline by the natural 
              flow of oil or gas transport. This device, after inducing a magnetic 
              field to flow through the pipe wall, measures flux leakage using 
              Hall effect sensors, which are located all around the circumference 
              of the pig. When the sensors travel by an area where there is an 
              anomaly of some kind in the pipe wall, there is a resulting fringing 
              effect in the flux leakages that leads to a change in output level 
              from the sensors. The sensor outputs are stored on-board the pig. 
              The data gathered in this way constitute an image of the interior 
              of the entire pipe. The business of the industrial sponsor, Pipetronix 
              Ltd., is to provide such a pipeline inspection service to its clients.</p></td>

            regarding this imaging process</font> <ul>
              <li>Potentially harmful defects caused by corrosion in the interior 
                pipe surface are easily detected by this magnetic technique. The 
                detection of the defects themselves, and the determination of 
                the size and shape of these defects are the primary reasons why 
                the pipeline is inspected, and hence are the items of critical 
                concern to the client.</li>
              <li>A direct technique for fabricating pipelines is to bend steel 
                sheets into cylinders (referred to as "long seam" pipes). The 
                cylinders are then butt-welded (to form "girth welds") together 
                on-site. The images of the resulting long seam and girth welds, 
                which constitute a completed pipeline section, are items of interest 
                to Pipetronix and its clients.</li>
              <li>Another more sophisticated technique for the fabrication of 
                pipe is to force a mandrill down the centre of a red-hot cylindrical 
                section of steel. The pipe is formed after several passes with 
                successively larger mandrills. This type of pipe is referred to 
                as "seamless". This process results in pipe which is scored on 
                the inside. This scoring results in a significant level of background 
                "noise" in the magnetic image, and can obscure significant defects 
                or other areas of concern.</li>
              <li>A pipeline usually contains flanges, fittings, valves, etc. 
                , of various sorts. The identification and location of these items 
                is of interest to the client.</li>
              <li>Currently, a simple image compression algorithm is used in storing 
                the data on-board the pig. This algorithm introduces occasional 
                anomalies into the reconstructed image, referred to as "reset 
                noise". It is important to identify this noise as a distinct class 
                of object so that it is not confused with an actual item of interest.</li>
              <li>The magnetic sensors have a point-spread function (PSF) of significant 
                width, in both dimensions. This PSF is not known a priori, since 
                it changes over varying conditions encountered on a run. The effect 
                of this PSF is to blur and degrade the image quality.</li>

            <p class="f">A typical magnetic image of a section of <em>long seam</em> 
              pipe is shown in <a class="n" href="../html/images/image_jim_fig11.jpg"> 
              Fig. 1</a>. The vertical axis is the circumferential direction of 
              the pipe (sensor index), whereas the horizontal axis is along the 
              axial direction of the pipe (time-sample index). Colour represents 
              magnetic intensity, going from red (least metal) to blue (most metal). 
              The letters "D", "R", and "W" represent regions of defect, reset 
              noise, and girth weld, respectively.</p>
            <p class="f">A typical magnetic image of a section of <em>seamless</em> 
              pipe is shown in <a class="n" href="../html/images/image_jim_fig21.jpg"> 
              Fig. 2</a>. The background noise characteristic due to the scoring 
              of the pipe during fabrication is clearly evident. In view of the 
              fact many of the red areas are NOT defects, it is also evident from 
              the figure how defects (marked as before with a "D") can be obscured 
              by the noise. We note that the noise characteristic is far from 
              white in both spatial dimensions. This fact enables gains to be 
              made in the detection of defects by using intelligent signal processing 
              schemes.</p>

            <p class="f">Currently, the stored data collected from the pig is 
              analyzed by human operator, to identify regions of defect, weld 
              types, etc. The intent of this co-operative research and development 
              (CRD) project is to develop methods for streamlining and automating 
              this analysis process. This poses many interesting and challenging 
              signal and image processing problems including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The classification of installation type: seamless or non-seamless. 
              </li>
              <li>The classification and detection of all objects of interest: 
                defects, welds, areas of metal gain and metal loss, reset noise, 
                flanges, etc. , into their respective classes. </li>
              <li>The detection of defects that are masked by the background noise 
                in seamless pipe.</li>
              <li>The compression of data: The quantity of data generated by the 
                magnetic scanning process is huge. Therefore, there is a demand 
                for state-of-the-art image compression techniques which can reduce 
                the quantity of data which must be stored on-board the pig to 
                a minimum, while still preserving the best possible reconstructed 
                image quality.</li>
              <li>The deconvolution of the image with the point spread function 
                (PSF) of the sensors, to produce an image of enhanced resolution. 
                This will improve classification performance and detectability 
                of defects, and will also aid in the assessment of the severity 
                of defects. Since the PSF is unknown and cannot be reliably determined 
                by conventional means, the deconvolution must be done <i>blindly.</i></li>
