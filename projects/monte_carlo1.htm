          <p class="f">MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and MC Statistical Methods 
            are very powerful statistical techniques for parameter estimation 
            and related problems. They are particularly useful for the difficult 
            nonlinear or non-Gaussian case. Using a large data set, these techniques 
            can also be used to make inference on parameters, to integrate nuisance 
            parameters, to evaluate functions numerically or to solve optimization 
            problems. See

          <p>We have applied these methods to several interesting problems: (J-R. 
            Larocque)</p>
          <p class="bold"> 1) Joint model order detection and DOA estimation in 
            coloured noise</p>
          <p class="f"> Model order detection has always been a difficult problem 
            in array signal processing w hen the noise is coloured. A novel reversible 
            jump MCMC approach has been proposed to solve this problem (IEEE Trans 
            Signal Processing, Feb., 2002). <a class="n" href="../html/papers/jr/coloured_noise.pdf" target="_blank">Download.</a> 
          </p>
          <p class="bold"> 2) Tracking of multiple targets using arrays of sensors 
          </p>
          <p class="f"> In this project, arrays of sensors are used to detect 
            the number of targets and to jointly track their directions of arrival, 
            using particle filters, or sequential Monte Carlo approaches. These 
            methods approach real-time efficiency and show considerable advantages 
            over previous techniques. A submission has been made to IEEE Trans. 
            SP. <a class="n" href="../html/papers/jr/part.pdf" target="_blank">Download.</a> 
          </p>
          <p class="bold"> 3) Applications to 3G </p>
          <p class="f"> It is envisaged that third generation wireless systems 
            will include an antenna array, at least at the base station and at 
            the mobile not too long after. Channel modelling is required for these 
            systems for calculation of outage,etc. Channel modelling in turn requires 
            accurate measurement and estimation of the channel. <br>
            <br>
            The Reversible Jump MCMC sampling scheme was applied to real-life 
            outdoor propagation measurements for the purpose of channel estimation. 
            An experimental wideband CDMA receiver was built for collecting propagation 
            data. Excellent correspondence between the results estimated from 
            the MCMC algorithm and geographical thruthing were obtained. A submission 
            has been made to IEEE Trans. Vehicular Technology. <a class="n" href="../html/papers/jr/jad.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a>

          <p>The following work is being done by William Ng</p>
          <p class="f">Work is now in progress with the objective of using MCMC 
            and sequential MC methods for restoration of signals using sensor 
            arrays; i.e., we wish to extract a signal of interest from multiple 
            interfering sources. This has been accomplished for the <a class="n" href="../html/papers/william/ndbf.pdf" target="_blank">narrowband</a> 
            case, and work has been extended to the more difficult wideband case.</p>
