          <p class="f">A popular method of oil and gas pipeline inspection is 
            through automated magnetic imaging. The residual intensity image of 
            the interior pipe wall generated through this process is subsequently 
            analyzed to identify and classify anomalies and defects. Such a method 
            allows for preventive maintenance of the pipe in a cost effective 
            manner.<br>
            <br>
            One of the major problems involved in this application is the quantity 
            of data. For example, the robotic device collecting image information 
            can easily collect 1000GB of raw data for typical large pipes. Obviously 
            the exact amount of data varies according to the sampling rate (typically 
            between 10 to 12 bits/sample), the number of circumferential sensors 
            located on the device (depends on pipe diameter), and the length of 
            the pipe. In any case, this quantity of data is expensive to store 
            and awkward to process. Lossless compression techniques cannot yield 
            significant ratios where as traditional lossy compression (such as 
            JPEG) can eliminate details which are imperative to the defect detection 
            and quantification process.</p></td>

          <p class="f">The objective of this research has been to look at wavelets 
            and multiresolution techniques for effective compression of such images. 
            The broad field of wavelets offer excellent energy-compacting ability 
            (vanishing moments), distortion suppression (regularity) characteristics 
            and time-frequency localization properties that make them ideal candidates 
            for compression applications. Wavelet methods can be particularly 
            effective when combined with an effective quantization (such as Zerotree 
            scalar or vector quantization) and entropy coding scheme (such as 
            Huffman or Arithmetic). </p></td>

          <p class="f">We used a variation of the well known Embedded Zerotree 
            Wavelet (EZW) algorithm (see J. Shapiro. Embedded image coding using 
            zerotrees of wavelet coefficients. IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 
            41(12): 3445-3462, 1993) for effective compression of such images.

            of a wavelet basis according to the image under analysis for an increase 
            in the reconstructed iimage quality and/or compression ratio. An object-based 
            compression approach involving the parsing of the original image into 
            semantically meaningful objects for separate encoding is also being 
            studied.</p></td>
