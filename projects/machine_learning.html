              Learning for Major Depression</font></p>
            <p class="f" >Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious and common 
              mental disorder and is a major cause of workplace disability, with 
              costs very similar to those of diabetes and heart disease. By the 
              year 2020, depression is expected to account for about 15% of total 
              global disease burden, second only to ischemic heart disease. In 
              industrialized countries mental illnesses may account for about 
              16\% of total health care costs and for about 30% of disability 
              claims.</p>
            <p>There are approximately 22 available anti--depressant medications 
              for the treatment of MDD that are divided into four classes. Each 
              class functions by altering levels of particular neuro-transmitters 
              in the brain. Despite the severity and extensiveness of MDD, objective 
              procedures for selecting which of these medications is optimal for 
              a specific individual are lacking. Therefore the psychiatrist, when 
              treating MDD, must by necessity resort to a trial-and-error procedure 
              to determine an effective treatment. Typically 60 to 70% of those 
              treated do not remit after the first antidepressant medication trial. 
              Although about 67% will eventually reach remission, up to 4 different 
              antidepressant treatment trials may be required, each taking 6 weeks 
              or longer. The personal and economic cost of delayed or ineffective 
              therapy is substantial, in that in the interval required to reach 
              remission, the patient is likely to be disabled, unable to work, 
              prone to suicide, and suffer intensely.</p>
            <p><strong>The objective</strong> of this project is to develop machine 
              learning (ML) methods that can predict the response of a particular 
              subject to various therapies for MDD, before treatment begins. The 
              ML methods are based on analysis of the subject&#8217;s pre-treatment, 
              resting EEG, perhaps complemented by additional biomarkers. The 
              successful development of such a facility will have a major disruptive 
              effect in the practice of psychiatry, since it will significantly 
              improve the chances of an effective treatment being prescribed in 
              the first instance.</p>
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> So far, we have developed prediction 
              models, based on pilot study data, to predict response to SSRIs 
              (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are a commonly prescribed 
              form of anti-depressant medication), and to repetitive transcranial 
              magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which is a new, non-invasive form of 
              therapy for the treatment of MDD. We have also developed similar 
              models for prediction of response to the anti-psychotic drug clozapine, 
              which is very effective in treating schizophrenia. Our prediction 
              accuracies in each case are 80% or better.</p>

            <p><font size="2">This figure shows the clustering of the responder 
              (R) and non-responder (NR) classes for prediction of response to 
              an SSRI medication for MDD. A 5-dimensional feature space was projected 
              down to two dimensions using kernelized principal component analysis. 
              The separation of the two classes is clearly evident, indicating 
              that accurate prediction of response to the therapy can be made.</font></p>

            <p class="f" >Current research in this area involves the development 
              of new machine learning methods for this application. Specifically, 
              we are investigating the use of brain source localization methods, 
              improved methods for feature selection and classification, as well 
              as improved kernelization techniques to improve the robustness and 
              accuracy of our predictions.</p>
            <p>With financial support from Magstim Ltd., Carmarthenshire, Wales, 
              we are currently in the process of expanding the extent of the available 
              training base, and extending the machine learning prediction approach 
              to a broader range of therapies for MDD.</p>
            <p>We are also extending machine learning methodology to perform diagnosis 
              of psychiatric illness, based on the subject&#8217;s resting EEG.</p>

            <p class="f">The machine learning prediction methods discussed above 
              have been extended to the determination of the age of infants, based 
              on their event-related potentials in response to an audio stimulus. 
              Infant age can be categorized into 6-month old, 12-month old, and 
              adult classes. The method can be used to evaluate the chronological 
              age vs. the &#8220;neurological age&#8221; of an infant, thereby 
              indicating potential developmental delay.<br>
              <br>
              Proposed research in this area involves the use of brain source 
              localization methods to determine the neurological space-time response 
              to various stimuli. The objective is to provide deeper insight into
