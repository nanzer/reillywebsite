				<p>Dr. Armanfard is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.  She obtained her PhD degree from McMaster University, Canada in 2016. The focus of her PhD research was on developing effective machine learning algorithms for data classification. In this vein, she proposed and developed the novel concept of localized feature selection (LFS) and classification. The LFS method demonstrates superior performance for classification in complex and high dimensional sample spaces. She also developed a novel machine learning based system for automatic and continuous coma patient assessment and outcome prediction.</p>
				<p>Matlab code for the LFS method is available here: <a href="https://github.com/armanfn/LFS" target="_blank">https://github.com/armanfn/LFS</a></p>

				<p>Wavelet-based Muscle Artifact Noise Reduction for rTMS Evoked Potentials:  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has recently emerged as a successful treatment for major depressive disorder.  A novel wavelet de-artifacting procedure was developed that suppresses the magnetic artifact and allows adjustment of the stimulus parameters for maximum effect.</p>

				<center><img src="assets/boshra.jpg" alt="Rober Boshra"></center></a>
				<p>Rober is presently a post-doctoral fellow working in Prof. Sabine Kastner’s lab at Princeton University.</p>
				<p>Rober's primary research topic pertains to local brain potentials, recorded from the human cortex (electrocorticography), and their relation to both scalp event-related potentials and high frequency brain oscillations. Rober is interested in the analysis of such recorded signals in conjunction with state-of-the-art machine learning and digital signal processing techniques (primarily machine learning) to elucidate facets of consciousness, cognition, and language processing.</p>

				<h3>Omar Nassif</h3><center><img src="assets/person.png" alt="Omar Nassif"></center>
				<p>Omar Nassif completed his Master’s degree in the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering in September, 2020.  He was co-supervised by Prof. Jim Reilly in the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Prof. Vickie Galea, School of Rehabilitation Science. He used machine learning methods to characterize premature infant motor movement for assessment of potential neurological deficits. He extracted features from video sequences of infant movements and then used supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to analyze the data.   In the unsupervised case, he demonstrated that infant movement patterns cluster into distinct groups that roughly correspond to infant age group.  In the supervised case, he showed that pathological cases classified into age groups that were lower than the chronological age of the infant.  The method therefore provides a clinical facility for identifying neurological deficit in infants.</p>
