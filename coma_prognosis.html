  <p>The electroencephalogram (EEG) measures neural electrical  activity from the brain that appears on the scalp.   Event-related potentials (ERPs) are the  brain&rsquo;s response (measured by the EEG) to some form of stimulus (in our case, a  short auditory tone).  The <em>odd-ball  paradigm</em> intersperses infrequent (deviant) stimuli amongst more frequent (standard)  stimuli.  The mismatched negativity (MMN)  component occurs in response to a deviant stimulus (see figure below).</p>
<p>Previous  work, e.g. [1,2], has shown that the existence of the MMN component in the  deviant response of a coma patient has a high predictive value for emergence  from coma.  The difficulty is that the MMN  component is difficult to detect in the presence of background EEG noise at the  best of times, and even more so in a coma patient.  The result is that there exists a significant  chance of emergence even if the patient&rsquo;s MMN component is not visible.  </p>

<p style="font-size:.85em;">EEG responses to standard (red) and deviant (blue) stimuli.   In this case, the MMN peak is clearly evident.  However in many other cases it is difficult to distinguish between the two types of responses.<br>

<p>The purpose  of this study is to use machine learning methods to improve detectability of  the MMN component and therefore provide a high-accuracy clinical tool with both  high specificity and high sensitivity for determining prognosis for emergence  from coma.  Details are presented in [3].</p>
<p>  We also  intend to use machine learning methods to diagnose and characterize other forms  of disorders of consciousness, such as vegetative state, minimally conscious  state, and concussion.</p>
<p>The study is  funded by a major <em>collaborative health research project</em> (CHRP) grant,  sponsored by NSERC and CIHR.</p>
<p>This is a  multi—disciplinary study, consisting of the following researchers:</p>
