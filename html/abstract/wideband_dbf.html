            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> &nbsp; In most solutions 
              to state estimation problems, e.g., target tracking, it is generally 
              assumed that the state transition and measurement models are known 
              a priori. However, there are situations where the model parameters 
              or the model structure itself are not known a priori or are known 
              only partially. In these scenarios, standard estimation algorithms 
              like the Kalman filter and the extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which 
              assume perfect knowledge of the model parameters, are not accurate. 
              In this paper, the nonlinear state estimation problem with possibly 
              non-Gaussian process noise in the presence of a certain class of 
              measurement model uncertainty is considered. It is shown that the 
              problem can be considered as a special case of maximum likelihood 
              estimation with incomplete-data. Thus, in this paper, we propose 
              an EM-type algorithm that casts the problem in a joint state estimation 
              and model parameter identification framework. The expectation (E) 
              step is implemented by a particle filter that is initialized by 
              a Monte-Carlo Markov chain algorithm. Within this step, the posterior 
              distribution of the states given the measurements, as well as the 
              state vector itself, are estimated. Consequently, in the maximization 
              (M) step, we approximate the nonlinear observation equation as a 
              mixture of Gaussians (MoG) model. During the M-step, the MoG model 
              is fit to the observed data by estimating a set of MoG parameters. 
              The proposed procedure, called EM-PF (expectation–maximization particle 
              filter) algorithm, is used to solve a highly nonlinear bearing-only 
              tracking problem, where the model structure is assumed unknown a 
              priori. It is shown that the algorithm is capable of modelling the 
              observations and accurately tracking the state vector. Additionally, 
              the algorithm is also applied to the sensor registration problem 
              in a multi–sensor fusion scenario. It is again shown that the algorithm 
              is successful in accommodating an unknown nonlinear model for a 
              target tracking scenario. </p>
