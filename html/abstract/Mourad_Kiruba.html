            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> &nbsp; In this paper 
              we propose two different algorithms for extracting a desired sparse 
              source signal from a linear mixture of hidden source signals in 
              the presence of noise when prior information about the desired source 
              signal is available. The first algorithm extracts a desired source 
              signal using a temporal reference signal, while the second algorithm 
              uses a spatial reference vector that conveys information about the 
              mixing column associated with the desired source signal. Previous 
              methods addressing this problem have used algorithms based on the 
              l1 norm for encouraging sparsity. However, it has been shown that 
              certain non-convex functions perform better than l1 based methods 
              for this purpose, in terms of probability of exact reconstruction 
              and the required number of iterations for convergence. In this paper, 
              we extend the previous work in this area by exploiting recent algorithms 
              developed by the authors that use these improved non-convex functions. 
              In the temporally constrained case, the desired separating vector 
              is obtained iteratively as the minimum latent vector of a particular 
              matrix. In the spatially constrained case, the separating vector 
              is determined as the solution to a set of linear equations. The 
              proposed algorithms are readily implementable and have useful applications 
              in the field of EEG/MEG signal processing. Numerical results show 
              that these algorithms significantly outperform some of the well 
              known algorithms that are usually employed for solving the same 
              problem particularly in terms of computational speed.</p>
