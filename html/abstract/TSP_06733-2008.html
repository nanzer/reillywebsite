            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> &nbsp; We consider 
              linear systems whose state parameters are separable into linear 
              and nonlinear sets, and evolve according to some known transition 
              distribution, and whose measurement noise is distributed according 
              to a mixture of Gaussians. In doing so, we propose a novel particle 
              filter that addresses the optimal state estimation problem for the 
              aforementioned class of systems. The proposed filter, referred to 
              as the ACM-PF, is a combination of the approximate conditional mean 
              filter and the sequential importance sampling particle filter. The 
              algorithm development depends on approximating a mixture of Gaussians 
              distribution with a moment-matched Gaussian in the weight update 
              recursion. A condition indicating when this approximation is valid 
              is given. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, 
              we address the blind signal detection problem for an impulsive flat 
              fading channel and the tracking of a maneuvering target in the presence 
              of glint noise. Extensive computer simulations were carried out. 
              For computationally intensive implementations (large number of particles), 
              the proposed algorithm offers performance that is comparable to 
              other state–of–the–art particle filtering algorithms. In the scenario 
              where computational horsepower is heavily constrained, it is shown 
              that the proposed algorithm offers the best performance amongst 
              the considered algorithms for these specific examples. </p>
