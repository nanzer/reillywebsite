            <p class = "author">Submitted to <em>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 
              August 2003.</em><br>

            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> &nbsp; This paper 
              proposes a novel online tracking and detection algorithm for wideband 
              array signal processing. Based on the wideband data model in [1], 
              this method extends the sequential Monte Carlo methods (otherwise 
              known as particle filtering) techniques for recursive state estimation. 
              This proposed method finds application in various areas of telecommunications, 
              including radar, sonar, and other wireless communication problems, 
              where locating moving targets and extracting the waveforms for classification 
              are needed.<br>
              <br>
              The proposed method recusively estimates the direction-of-arrival 
              (DOA) information corresponding to the sources. The proposed method 
              first detects the number of unknown wideband sources using a hypothesis 
              testing procedure, followed by the sequential estimation of the 
              DOAs of these identified sources and the waveform extraction of 
              these sources using a particle filter. Computer simulations demonstrate 
              the ability of the proposed method to detect the time-varying nunber 
              of sources in different scenarios as time progresses. The results 
              also show that the DOA trajectories of the identified sources are 
              well tracked and their signal waveforms are also well restored. 
              Finally, the posterior Cram´er-Rao bound (PCRB) [2] is also presented 
              to demonstrate that the estimates by the proposed method lie consistently 
              within the bound. </p>
