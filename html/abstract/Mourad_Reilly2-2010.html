            <strong>N. Mourad and J. Reilly</strong> <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> 
              &nbsp; The under-determined blind source separation (BSS) prob- 
              lem is usually solved using the sparse component analysis (SCA) 
              technique. In SCA, the BSS is usually solved in two steps, where 
              the mixing matrix is estimated in the first step, while the sources 
              are estimated in the second step. In this paper we propose a novel 
              clustering algorithm for estimating the mixing matrix and the number 
              of sources, which is usually unknown. The proposed algorithm is 
              based on incorporating a statistical test with a hierarchical clustering 
              (HC) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on sequentially 
              extracting compact clusters that have been constructed by the HC 
              algorithm, where the extraction decision is based on the statistical 
              test. To identify the number of sources, as well as the clusters 
              corresponding to the columns of the mixing matrix, we develop a 
              quan- titative measure called the concentration parameters. Two 
              numerical examples are presented to present the ability of the proposed 
              algorithm in estimating the mixing matrix and the number of sources.</p>
