          <em>Submitted to IEEE. Trans. 
          Neural Networks, Special Issue on Data-based Optimization, Control and 
          Modeling, Jan. 2011. </em><br> <strong>U. Gunturkan, James P. Reilly,

            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> &nbsp; In this article 
              we address the estimation of additive driving&#8211;forces (e.g. 
              hidden inputs) in nonlinear dynamic systems. We assume varying amounts 
              of a priori knowledge on the underlying system and focus on three 
              typical scenarios that are frequently faced in practice: 1) there 
              is no sufficient prior knowledge to build a mathematical model of 
              the underlying system; 2) the system is partially described by an 
              analytical model; 3) a complete and accurate model of the underlying 
              system is available.</p>
            <p>Arguably, the first scenario possesses the most common and the 
              most challenging aplications in practice, where we have to retrieve 
              the information of interest using only a set of output measurements. 
              Motivated by this fact, our emphasis in this paper is on building 
              and expanding upon the adaptive driving&#8211; force estimator (ADFE), 
              which has been proposed in [1, 2] for the retrieval of driving&#8211;forces 
              from everywhere&#8211;differentiable nonlinear systems with unknown 
              dynamics.</p>
            <p>The more optimistic second and the third estimation scenarios are 
              addressed using some state&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;art techniques 
              that are well&#8211;suited for each scenario respectively. In particular, 
              the expectation&#8211;maximization (EM) algorithm is combined with 
              a particle filter and used for estimating the missing data in the 
              second sceniaro, and the Rao&#8211;Blackwellized particle filter 
              is used for exploiting all the prior knowledge in an approximately 
              optimum fashion for the third scenario.</p>
            <p>In order to explore the usefulness of the ADFE, all techniques 
              are compared on a nonlinear dynamic system in a unified manner. 
              An equivalent amount of computational resources is provided for 
              each technique for a fair comparison, and the qualities of the estimators 
              are judged by the Posterior Cramer&#8211;Rao Lower Bound (PCRB). 
              The experimental results reveal that the adaptive driving&#8211;force 
              estimator is a favorable method for the estimation of rapidly&#8211;varying 
              hidden inputs unless a complete and accurate model of the underlying 
              system is available.<br>
