            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> &nbsp; Objective: To 
              investigate whether applying advanced machine learning (ML) methodologies 
              to pre-treatment electroencephalography (EEG) data can predict the 
              response to clozapine therapy in adult subjects suffering from chronic 
              schizophrenia. </p>
            <p>Methods: Pre-treatment EEG data are collected in 23 + 14 schizophrenic 
              adults. Treatment outcome, after at least one year follow-up, is 
              determined using clinical ratings by a trained clinician blind to 
              EEG results. First, a feature selection scheme is employed to select 
              a reduced subset of features extracted from the subjects&#8217; 
              EEG that is most statistically relevant to our treatment-response 
              prediction. These features are then entered into a classifier, which 
              is realized in the form of a kernel partial least squares regression 
              method that performs response prediction. Various scales, including 
              the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) are used as treatment-response 
              indicators.</p>
            <p>Results: We determined that a set of discriminating EEG features 
              do exist. A low-dimensional represen- tation of the feature space 
              showed significant clustering into clozapine responder and non-responder 
              groups. The minimum level of performance of the proposed prediction 
              methodology, tested over a range of conditions using the leave-one-out 
              cross-validation method using the original 23 subjects, with further 
              testing in an independent sample of 14 subjects, was 85%.</p>
            <p>Conclusions: These findings indicate that analysis of pre-treatment 
              EEG data can predict the clinical response to clozapine in treatment 
              resistant schizophrenia. Significance: If replicated in a larger 
              population, this novel approach to EEG analysis may assist the clini- 
              cian in determining treatment-efficacy.</p>
