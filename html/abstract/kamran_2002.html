            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
              paper discusses a frequency domain method for blind identification 
              of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) convolutive channels driven 
              by white quasistationary sources. The sources can assume arbitrary 
              probability distributions, and in some cases, they can even be all 
              Gaussian distributed. We also show that under slightly more restrictive 
              assumptions, the algorithm can be applied to the case when the sources 
              are colored, nonstationary signals. We demonstrate that by using 
              the second-order statistics of the channel outputs, under mild conditions 
              on the nonstationarity of sources, and under the condition that 
              channel is column-wise coprime, the impulse response of the MIMO 
              channel can be identified up to an inherent scaling and permutation 
              ambiguity. We prove that by using the new algorithm, under the stated 
              assumptions, a uniform permutation across all frequency bins is 
              guaranteed, and the inherent frequency-dependent scaling<br>
              ambiguities can be resolved. Hence, no post processing is required, 
              as is the case with previous frequency domain algorithms. We further 
              present an efficient, two-step frequency domain algorithm for identifying 
              the channel. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate 
              the performance of the new algorithm</p>
