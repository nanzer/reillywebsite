              of Infants Using Auditory Evoked Potentials</p>
         <em>To appear, Clinical Neurophysiology, 
          2011. </em><br> <strong>M. Ravan, J. Reilly, L. Trainor and A. Khodayari-Rostamabad</strong>
            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> &nbsp; Objective: To 
              develop a high performance machine learning (ML) approach for predicting 
              the age and consequently the state of brain development of infants, 
              based on their event related potentials (ERPs) in response to an 
              auditory stimulus. </p>
            <p>Methods: The ERP responses of twenty-nine 6-month-olds, nineteen 
              12-month-olds and ten adults to an auditory stimulus were derived 
              from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The most relevant wavelet 
              coefficients corresponding to the first- and second-order moment 
              sequences of the ERP signals were then identified using a feature 
              selection scheme that made no a priori assumptions about the features 
              of interest. These features are then fed into a classifier for determination 
              of age group.<br>
              Results: We verified that ERP data could yield features that discriminate 
              the age group of individual subjects with high reliability. A low 
              dimensional representation of the selected feature vectors show 
              significant clustering behavior corresponding to the subject age 
              group. The performance of the proposed age group prediction scheme 
              was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation method and 
              found to exceed 90% accuracy.</p>
            <p>Conclusions: This study indicates that ERP responses to an acoustic 
              stimulus can be used to predict the age and consequently the state 
              of brain development of infants.</p>
            <p>Significance: This study is of fundamental scientific significance 
              in demonstrating that a machine classification algorithm with no 
              a priori assumptions can classify ERP responses according to age 
              and with further work, potentially provide useful clues in the understanding 
              of the development of the human brain. A potential clinical use 
              for the proposed methodology is the identification of developmental 
              delay: an abnormal condition may be suspected if the age estimated 
              by the proposed technique is significantly less than the chronological 
              age of the subject.</p>
