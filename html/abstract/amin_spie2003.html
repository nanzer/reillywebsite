                                In most solutions to state
                                estimation problems like, for example target
                                tracking, it is generally assumed that the state
                                evolution and measurement models are known a
                                priori. The model parameters include process and
                                measurement matrices or functions as well as the
                                corresponding noise statistics. However, there
                                are situations where the model parameters are
                                not known a priori or are known only partially
                                (i.e., with some uncertainty). Moreover, there
                                are situations that the measurement is biased.
                                In these scenarios, standard estimation
                                algorithms like Kalman filter and extended
                                Kalman Filter (EKF), which assume perfect
                                knowledge of the model parameters, are not
                                accurate anymore. The problem with uncertain
                                model parameters is considered as a special case
                                of maximum likelihood estimation with
                                incomplete-data, for which a standard solution
                                called the expectation maximization (EM)
                                algorithm exists. In this paper a new extension
                                to the EM algorithm is proposed to solve the
                                more general problem of joint state estimation
                                and model parameter identification for nonlinear
                                systems with possibly non-Gaussian noise. In the
                                expectation (E) step, it is shown that the best
                                variational distribution over the state
                                variables is the conditional posterior
                                distribution of states given all the available
                                measurements and inputs. Therefore, a particular
                                type of particle filter is used to estimate and
                                update the posterior distribution. In the
                                maximization (M) step the nonlinear measurement
                                process parameters are approximated using a
                                nonlinear regression method for adjusting the
                                parameters of a mixture of Gaussians (MofG). The
                                proposed algorithm is used to solve a nonlinear
                                bearing-only tracking problem similar to the one
                                reported recently12 with uncertain measurement
                                process. It is shown that the algorithm is
                                capable of accurately tracking the state vector
                                while identifying the unknown measurement
                                dynamics. Simulation results show the advantages
                                of the new technique over standard algorithms
                                like the EKF that loose the track very rapidly
                                in uncertain model scenario.</p>
