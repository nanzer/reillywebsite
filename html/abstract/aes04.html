            <p class = "abstract"> <strong>Abstract</strong> &nbsp; This paper 
              discusses a frequency domain method for blind identification of 
              MIMO convolutive channels driven by white quasi-stationary sources. 
              The sources can assume arbitrary probability distributions and in 
              some cases they can even be all Gaussian distributed. We also show 
              that under slightly more restrictive assumptions the algorithm can 
              be applied to the case when the sources are colored, non-stationary 
              signals. We demonstrate that by using the second order statistics 
              of the channel outputs, under mild conditions on the non-stationarity 
              of sources, and under the condition that channel is column-wise 
              coprime, the impulse response of the MIMO channel can be identified 
              up to an inherent scaling and permutation ambiguity. We prove that 
              by using the new algorithm, under the stated assumptions, a uniform 
              permutation across all frequency bins is guaranteed, and the inherent 
              frequency dependent scaling ambiguities can be resolved. Hence no 
              post processing is required as is the case with previous frequency 
              domain algorithms. We further present an efficient, two step frequency 
              domain algorithm for identifying the channel. Numerical simulations 
              are presented to demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm.
